- All mandatory parts (boy/girl switch mapped on key X).

- Added sound effects and music
You can turn music off and on, and it get stored in preferencies for the next time.

- Boy
The boy can open dynamite boxes and explode them. Can also catch the honey
flask to attract the bees. The boy can lay the honey wherever he wants, can
move the bees and the girl by kicking them. He can be controlled by the keyboard.

- Girl
She can just open dynamite boxes to help the boy and take the coins. She has a
life bar associated and life decrease when she is attacked by a bee or get hit
by bombs or by the boy. She can be controlled by the keyboard.

- Bees
They fly randomly, but they keep track of their starting position and don't move
too far from the initial point. They are attracted by the honey flask (or by the
boy if he is holding the honey flask) and by the girl (the girl has more
priority). They can attack the girl and they die if get hit by a bomb.

insert his name that get stored online.

- Boy/girl keyboard control
Is possible to move the boy and the girl with the arrows.

HOW THINGS WORK
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Action/reaction model:
Instead of putting everithing in the world.py function, each agent has it's own
code. Each agent has the doAction and doReaction functions, HumanAgents (Boy and
Girl) also have getActionList function.

         Agent
         /   \
        /     \
  HumanAgent   \
   /     \      |--Bee       `\
 Boy    Girl    |--Dynamyte   |__ Those 4 inherit directly from Agent
                |--Chemist    |
                |--Priest    ./

getActionList returns a list of actions available for that agent to a specific
instance (eg. getActionList for boy to bee = ['kick' 'talk' 'inspect' ...]). Those
options get shown in the instanceMenu. When clicked, the function
doAction('actionName', ..., callback) is called for the actor that performed the
action. It takes also a callback function that will be performed on the action
target. Usually that callback function is the doReaction of the target. The
callback is performed when the first action is completed.

Example: exploding a dynamite with a kick

User is controlling the boy and click into a dynamite box:
    boy.getActions(dynInstance) -> ['kick', ...] -> show instance menu.
User click on 'kick':
    def callback():
        dynAgent.doReaction('kick', ...)
    boy.doAction('talk', dynInstance, ... , callback)

When the action is finished the callback is executed, and the dynamite
explodes.  In this way is easyer to add more functionalities to agents and to
execute code when the action is finished.

Girl and boy classes inherits from HumanAgent, and they share some code, for
example to talk, to inspect and to be driven by the keyboard.
